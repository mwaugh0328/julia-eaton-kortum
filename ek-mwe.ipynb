    "I'm teaching myself ``julia``. The simplest way for me todo so is to work with a model that I know extremely well---the Ricardian model of Eaton and Kortum (2002). So below I will outline the economic environment and then use the properties of ``julia`` to map the fundamental, mathematical environment into a computational/quantitative outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of performance properties, the more I reflect on this, this is a huge appeal of the ``julia`` language. We can express the code and design it in a way that most closely corresponds with the math/model. In contrast, in for example MATLAB, where the map from white board to computation is big.\n",

    "**Individual Goods Production.**\n",
    "Within a country, there is a continuum of intermediate goods indexed by $\\omega \\in [0, 1]$. As in the Ricardian model of \\citet{dornbusch1977comparative} and \\citet{eaton2002technology}, intermediate goods are not nationally differentiated. Thus, intermediate $\\omega$ produced in one country is a perfect substitute for the same intermediate $\\omega$ produced by another country. Competitive firms produce intermediate goods with linear production technologies:\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "q(\\omega) = z(\\omega) \\ell,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is the productivity level of firms and $\\ell$ is the number of efficiency units of labor. To ship a technology to another country, iceberg costs are incurred. I will write this as $\\tau_{hf}$ which is the value the home country must incur to buy from the foreign country. The notation here will correspond with the row, column format of a matrix, so for a given row all the trade costs across the different columns are the ones that they face to buy from different countries. Then the usual normalization here is that $\\tau_{hh} = 1$. Again, on the computer, this means that the diagonal entries are one."

    "**The Aggregator.** In this model, intermediate goods are aggregated by a competitive final-goods producer.

This helps as we can compute expenditure patterns while being agnostic about the actual size of the economy, i.e. $Q$. One useful relationship that builds on this is to condition on the source and aggregate to arrive at the share of goods purchased from another country. How does this work? \n",

In the computer, the code will be setup with the same row, column notation. So fix a row, then as you go across the different columns you'll view the share of expenditures the, say home country, coming from other countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "A small side note: If you stare at this enough (and know the liturature), than you can start to see a gravity like relationship here without even imposing the Frechet assumption. The key issue essentially is the conditional distribution of goods prices and how it relates to the aggregate, home CES price index discussed next.\n",

What this means is for each $\\omega$ variety, in say the home country, the technology/productivity to produce that good is a random $z$ which is characterized by the distribution above. As I'll talk about below, what this allows one to think about is (i) if you hand me a distribution from which I can simulate from (ii) then with assumptions on market structure I can construct prices and (iii) with prices I can construct trade flows.\n",

On the computer..there are only two limiting factors (i) can you simulate from the distribution and (ii) the empirical question of how to discipline the distribution from which you are simulating. \n",

This wage is the same independent of the labor market / goods-producing sector / etc. This derives from the (within-country) free mobility of labor assumption (which I did not talk about). In some other notebooks, I'll relax this. But for now, labor is freely mobile and now we just need to find the wage so that labor demand equals labor supply. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second observation is that given competitive firms and that they face the wage rate $w$, we know that their marginal cost (and hence price at which they are willing to sell the good domestically) must be:\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_{f,h}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tau_{f,h} w_{h}}{z_{h}(\\omega)}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The third question is who buys what from whom? This aspect of the model is that really is just an application of the min operator. So buy the good from the country with the lowest price:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_{h}(\\omega) = \\min\\left\\{ \\frac{w_{h}}{z_{h}(\\omega)}, \\ \\frac{\\tau_{h,f} w_{f}}{z_{f}(\\omega)} \\right\\}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",

    "where the thing on the left is the domestic price, and then the thing on the right is on the world price (inclusive of the trade cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'm going to compute this via simulation. The idea will be to think of the product space $\\omega$ as an integer on the real line which indexes the goods location. Then for each of those products, each country is randomly assigned a productivity from the distribution. Then the number of goods, so to speak, is set to be large and thus will approximate the integrals above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given everything laid out, some wages $w_i$ and then primitives regarding technologies $T$, $\\theta$, $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ we can directly compute the pattern of trade. This is what I do below which is comprised of several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CES function ``ces_shares`` that takes prices and sourcing decisions to compute trade shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function that computes potential prices based on marginal costs, ``marginal_costs``\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function that constructs a vector of productivity for each good, across all countries, given the Frechet distribution, this is the ``make_productivity`` function. Note, future, it would be nice if the distribution type could be directly passed into this and also appropriately indexed. Maybe with a dictionary?"

    "I'm teaching myself ``julia``. The simplest way for me todo so is to work with a model that I know extremely well---the Ricardian model of Eaton and Kortum (2002). So below I will outline the economic environment and then use the properties of ``julia`` to map the fundemental, mathematical enviorment into a computational/quantitative outcome. Outside of performance properties, the more I reflect on this, this is a huge appeal of the ``julia`` language. In contrast, in for example MATLAB, the map from white board to computation is big.\n",

    "**Individual Goods Production.**\n",
    "Within a country, there is a continuum of intermediate goods indexed by $\\omega \\in [0, 1]$. As in the Ricardian model of \\citet{dornbusch1977comparative} and \\citet{eaton2002technology}, intermediate goods are not nationally differentiated. Thus, intermediate $\\omega$ produced in one country is a perfect substitute for the same intermediate $\\omega$ produced by another country. Competitive firms produce intermediate goods with linear production technologies,\n",

    "**The Aggregator** In this model, intermediate goods are aggregated by a competitive final-goods producer. In Julia, what would be interesting is to make the aggregator generic and let the user specify how this works.

    "which says that the value of of good $\\omega$ relative to total expenditures $P_h Q$ is given by the formula above. This helps as we can compute expenditure patterns while being agnostic about the actual size of the economy, i.e. $Q$. One useful relationship that builds on this is to condition on the source and aggregate to arrive at the share of goods purchased from another country. How does this work? \n",

    "Where the notation here $\\pi_{h,f}$ is the share of goods that the home country sources from the foreign country. This is equal do the integral over all goods purchased from them, hence, the conditioning where $p_h = p_{h,f}$ and then the inside of the brackets is the same as above. Easy.\n",

    "which takes all the prices at the micro-level and the is like a harmonic mean of these prices. Also note how one can substitute \\ref{eq:ces_price_index} into the share formula to get an expression of expenditures shares purely in terms of micro-level prices."
